USArrests dataset Visualization. Design and implementation of interactive visualization tools using Shiny.*

## Overview
This work expands the capabilities of visualization by providing an interactive platform thanks to the R Studio Shiny tool.
Using the Violent Crime Rates by US State dataset, several feats have been achieved:  
Shrinking the amount of individual representations by combining different visualizations or providing the ability to interact with each piece of knowledge in anyway. Allowing to any user to explore and interact with the apps and extract it own conclusions with may even differ from those of the creators of the app. This is found to be, in the opinion of the authors, the greatest advantage of this methodology.


##Interactive Tools: 
1. [Ranking of Arrests by State - Barchart](http://127.0.0.1:5240/)
2. [Arrest_Rate - Geo Map](http://127.0.0.1:5240/)
3. [Linear Regression and Scatter Plot](http://127.0.0.1:5240/)
4. [Crime by State - Barplot](http://127.0.0.1:5240/)
5. [Kmeans - Clustering Plot ](http://127.0.0.1:5240/)
